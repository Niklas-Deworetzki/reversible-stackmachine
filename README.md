# Kcats – Backwards on the Stack


This project is part of my master's degree at the *University of Applied Sciences THM* in Gießen, Germany. Its goal is to explore the design space of a reversible stack-based machine. The machine and its virtual machine implementation have three main design goals:
1. **Clean** – the instruction set should be clean, i.e. it does not generate garbage during execution and is therefore fully reversible.
2. **Simple** – the instruction set should not contain unnecessary complexity. Following this design goal, a RISC like instruction set is used for the machine.
3. **Performance-Oriented** – Execution should be fast: Decoding and executing instructions requires minimal computational power, yielding a high execution rate.
